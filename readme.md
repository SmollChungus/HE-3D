# Smoll's Hall Effect PCB 3D Files
## General notes
* QMK/VIA compatible
* For some switches with smaller diameter alignment pins, 4-6 screws might be needed to fix the PCB to the plate (holes are drilled for GEON Raptor switches) 
* Fixed layout

## 60HE 0.1
* JST in bakeneko position
* Currently has superfluous mounting holes between the switches for prototyping purposes as per the alignment pin situation mentioned above
